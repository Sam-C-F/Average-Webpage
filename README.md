# Average Webpage

This project is a simple web page allowing a user to input a series of numbers and get the _mean_, _median_ and _mode_ averages.

To run this project in your local environment **fork** and **clone**
[this repository](https://github.com/Sam-C-F/Average-Webpage.git).

The parent respository contains the function to return the three types of averages and the TDD undertaken to achieve this. This relies upon Jest which is a developer dependency. To install this run **npm install**. Run **npm test averages.test.js** to run the tests on this function.

Enter into the react app folder by typing **cd average-of-series/** into the command line then run **npm start** to run the application in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
